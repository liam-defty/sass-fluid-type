# Fluid Type

An experimental set of Sass mixins for creating fluid type & vertical rhythm using the vw unit and calc. 

## Getting Started

Include `_fluid-type.scss` in your project. Or, if you use npm, `npm install liam-defty/sass-fluid-type`.

## What is it?

Using the vw unit we can create fluid typography. This means we can scale the font size depending on the width of the browser. We handle this with certain parameters when doing so to ensure we have control over the font size and the breakpoints in which it scales. By doing this we can utilise `rem` and `em` units for a global or component based scaling of components. On top of this we create a fluid baseline that scales with the font size to create a beautiful vertical rhythm based on the "golden ratio". 

To see a basic example see the example folder.

# Fluid Vr

An experimental set of Sass mixins for creating fluid vertical rhythm using the vw unit and calc. 

## Getting Started

Include `_fluid-vr.scss` in your project. Or, if you use npm, `npm install liam-defty/sass-fluid-vr`.

## What is it?

Using the vw unit we can create `fluid typography`. This means we can scale the font size depending on the width of the browser. Fluid Vr handles this with certain parameters when doing so to ensure we have control over the font size and the breakpoints in which it scales. On top of this we create a fluid baseline that scales with the font size to create a beautiful vertical rhythm. 

To see a basic example clone this repo and view `example/index.html` in a browser.

## To Do

- Add comments to _fluid-vr.scss.
- Write docs.
- Write tests.
